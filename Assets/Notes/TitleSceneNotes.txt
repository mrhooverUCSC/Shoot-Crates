UI based, most everything is in the main canvas.

"Manager" gameobject is not, it is the holder of the "TitleManager" script.

Main parts of the mainmenu:
There is a secondary scene loaded with the auto-play screenscaver.
This is loaded through the Manager script.
When the screen is tapped, the MainMenu appears, dragging with it its child buttons and pages.
Then, the 4 buttons are layered on top of the Main Menu, but below their respective pages.
In order to pull the buttons with the pages but not be a child of them to keep the visual order, the same animation plays on the 
   buttons and the pages at the same time, so the Buttons have container objects that have the same position as the pages, such that
   the animation affects them at the same speed at the same time.
